Mobile Architecture &amp; Programming 
1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
> I created a weight-tracking mobile app designed to help users set and achieve their weight goals, promoting good health. The primary goal of the app is to allow users to monitor their weight trends over time, make adjustments to their routines based on progress, and stay motivated. This app addresses the user need for a simple, efficient way to track weight and health-related goals without overwhelming them with unnecessary features.

2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
> The app included several key screens and features to ensure it met user needs. These included-
Login screen: To ensure user data was secure and accessible.
Goal weight setting screen: Allowing users to set personalized weight goals.
Dashboard screen: This displayed weight progress over time, showing trends and motivating users.
Weight entry screen: For users to log their weight, making it easy to track progress.
Settings screen: This included an option to toggle dark mode for user customization.
I designed the UI to be streamlined and intuitive, ensuring that users could easily navigate the app without confusion. This simplicity made the app more user-friendly and efficient, contributing to its success by helping users focus on their goals without getting distracted by complex features.

3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
> I used an iterative approach to coding, where I worked on coding and testing small increments during the design phase. This allowed me to identify and fix issues early, preventing a large build-up of problems later in the process. The advantage of this approach is that it ensures features are functional as they're being developed, making it easier to debug and implement new functionality. This strategy is something I will continue to use in future projects because it reduces the risk of large-scale errors and helps create a more stable codebase.

4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
> I tested my code in small increments to ensure each feature worked correctly as it was implemented. This process is critical because it allowed me to catch issues early and make adjustments quickly before they became more complex problems. Testing during development helped reveal areas of the app that needed improvement, ensuring a smoother, more user-friendly experience by the time the app was complete. Regular testing also gave me confidence in the app’s functionality.

5. Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
> One of the main challenges I faced was getting all the app features to work together smoothly, particularly ensuring the database and UI components integrated well. To overcome this, I had to innovate by using rigorous testing and debugging to identify where the issues were occurring. This allowed me to adjust my approach, making sure all features worked together seamlessly without interfering with one another, which ultimately contributed to a more polished final product.

6. In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
> I was particularly successful in creating the database and implementing CRUD operations. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, and these operations are essential for managing data within the app. Implementing CRUD allowed users to securely store and retrieve their weight data, update their progress, and delete entries when necessary. This component was a key part of the app’s functionality, and I believe it demonstrates my ability to manage databases effectively and implement fundamental data operations.
